‚óè Developed a free-to-use web application for taking personal notes and categorize them
‚óè Build a GraphQL API with TypeGraphQL for the GraphQL types and resolvers that ensures a robust codebase, server-side data validation, and a pleasant developer experience
‚óè Implemented a fast and scalable note categorization system through an M:N relationship and schema indexing, later employed to filter the notes, that concluded in better user performance
‚óè Designed a system that relies on the inner application state, which results in almost instant loading times
